            Meet Your Trainer <br> Bassil Edelbi 
        </h1>
        <p class="p1">
            There was a time where I felt uncomfortable in my clothes and my skin. I knew that I was carrying a little bit of extra weight compared to my friends around my age, and looking back now, it wasn't even that much. <br> But it was enough at the time to knock my confidence - it got me down and I tried to diet. <br> I didn't know what I was doing. I had no direction and without a plan, I made a lot of mistakes. I started to learn about nutrition and making slightly better food choices. I learned about training plans and making sure that the time I was spending in the gym was effective. <br>
            Then, in 2002 I joined the military. That was a pivotal time in my life because now my fitness wasn't just about how I looked and felt, it could have meant life or death for myself, my friends and colleagues in my Company. I took it seriously and got military fit. <br> It was a life-changing journey and for the first time, I felt like I fitted in. Throughout my career I completed a number of arduous courses, including P-Company and even finished three back to back ultra-marathons which tested my mental and physical ability. In 2011, I then became a Physical Training Instructor within the Army. <br>
            I was in the military for over 15 years. When I left, I took a high-profile management position with a lot of responsibility and stress. This led me away from my core passion of fitness and helping others achieve their health and wellbeing goals. I was in that job for two years, where the long and demanding hours meant my health took a back seat again. I knew that I didn't want to live that life and wanted to do something I have always been passionate about - ultimately leading me back into the fitness industry.

        <span> Why Choose BX Personal Trainer?</span>
    </h3>

    <p class="p1">
        At BX, I want to help men and women that have felt like they've been spinning their wheels with their fitness and health. I grasp that different diets can seem attractive and trying various solutions to find the style of eating that's right for you seems essential - but it can also slow your progress down while you are spending time on trial and error.
    </p>

    <p class="p1">
        I launched BX, Personal Training in Fareham, so I can help people cut to the chase and find what works for them best as a result of using science-backed methods and individualisation protocols that will bring the results they desire. If you've just started working out, but you'd like to make the best out of your sessions, I am here to help. If you've been training for some time but feel like you're stuck with your progress, I will show you how to overcome the plateau and start seeing results again.

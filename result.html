                    "During my plan with BX, I exceeded even my own pectations by losing 13lb and dropping 2 dress sizes
                    from a size 12 to a size 8! <br>
                    I always put off losing weight due to not knowing what to eat due to my dairy and gluten free
                    requirements and what exercises did not cause my bad joints to swell and what exercises actually
                    worked from the comfort of my own home. My confidence had hit rock bottom and I knew I had to do
                    something and after my first consultation with Rob I knew that he would be the one to help to get to
                    where I wanted to be. We worked together to come up with a suitable calorie deficit, meal ideas
                    suitable for me and workouts which would help me to achieve my goal of feeling more confident in my
                    own skin. I feel mentally and physically like a new person. This is all down to the skills I’ve
                    learn from Rob and having the confidence to be able to ask him for help and advice whenever I needed
                    it. <br>
                    The most important thing I can take away from my experience with Rob is that I have skills that I
                    can implement into my daily life forever. I feel confident for the first time in years and it is all
                    down to BX." <br><br><span>Beth Price</span>

                    to understand how to train properly and recognise my own bad habits that were stopping me loosing
                    weight and getting fitter. The workouts he plans are varied and always challenging. Importantly to
                    me, he takes the time to explain the benefit of each exercise how to make sure that I have the
                    correct posture. The training has 100% made a difference to me physically and boosted my confidence
                    to train more and keep pushing". <br><br><span> Sandy Frost</span>

                    my goals and interests but also varied what we do each time to keep it interesting and enjoyable. He
                    manages to find that perfect balance of pushing you to the point where you can just about do it
                    rather than to complete failure. I’ve loved the experience so far and have seen great results. I’ve
                    beaten running PB’s more than once, toned up a lot and I’m the strongest I’ve ever been. I think
                    that’s all pretty good at 45. I highly recommend Rob to anyone who really wants to put the effort in
                    and get in shape!"<br><br><span>Paul Renouf</span>

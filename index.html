            <span> PREMIUM ONLINE & INDIVIDUAL PERSONAL TRAINING IN Hamburg WITH Bassil Edelbi!

        <p class="p1">
            Throughout my fitness journey, I have helped hundreds of people to improve their relationship with food and their bodies. But more than that, they've extended their lives and put the spark back into their training. While variety is essential to keep you interested - too much variety might inhibit your progress. That's why, as a personal trainer in Hamburg, I want to help you stick with a training programme long enough that you see real results.
        </p>
        <p class="p1">
            When my clients start training, they see their time in the gym as something else to juggle. But they soon learn that the flexibility, nutritional coaching and support they receive has a positive knock-on effect into the rest of their lives. <br> They're more roductive at work, they're more present for their families and importantly, they start to like themselves again.

                    I love helping people stick with something that they not only get great results from but that they
                    enjoy too. Nowadays, people know that their physical and mental health is worth investing in,
                    recognising the benefits of outsourcing all the management of their health and fitness to a
                    professional. I am 100% committed to helping you build better relationships with food and your own
                    body, while building strength and confidence that will take not just your fitness, but your whole
                    life to the next level.
